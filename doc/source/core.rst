The "Work in progress" (WIP) label tells anyone looking at a change
that more updates are still needed. Both the change's owner and any
core reviewer can set the WIP statusː

* A change owner can set this label on their own review to mark that
  additional changes are still being made, and to avoid unnecessary
  reviews while that happens.

* A core reviewer can set the WIP label to acknowledge that a
  contributor will definitely need to do more work on a change rather
  than merely expressing an opinion on its readiness. This can be a
  great convenience to fellow reviewers. It allows the core reviewer
  to politely send the message that the change needs additional work
  while simultaneously removing it from the list of ready changes
  until that happens.

A WIP label gets reset when a new patch is uploaded. The reviewer
that sets a WIP label, can also reset it.
