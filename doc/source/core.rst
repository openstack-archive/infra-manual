The "Work in progress" (WIP) tag tells anyone looking at a change that more
updates are still needed. Both the change's owner and any core
reviewer can set the WIP statusÀê

* A change owner can set this tag on their own review to mark that
  additional changes are still being made, and to avoid unnecessary
  reviews while that happens.

* A core reviewer can set the WIP tag to acknowledge that a
  contributor will definitely need to do more work on a change rather
  than merely expressing an opinion on its readiness. This can be a
  great convenience to fellow reviewers. It allows the core reviewer
  to politely send the message that the change needs additional work
  while simultaneously removing it from the list of ready changes
  until that happens.
