Core Reviewer's Guide
#####################

Maintaining the Core Group
==========================

+/-2 votes
==========

Only core reviewers can give +2 and -2 votes. A vote of +2 indicates
that the core reviewer agrees that the patch can merge as is.

A vote of -2 blocks a patch completely, it should only be given in
exceptional cases. For example, if a patch is approved and currently
in the gate pipeline, a -2 will block it from merging.

Note that -2 votes are the only votes that are not reset when a new
patch gets uploaded. The core reviewer that gave a -2 is the only
person that can remove it again.

Approval
========


Once a patch has at least one +2 vote and neither any -2 votes or a
Work in Progress tag set, it is ready to be merged. Any core reviewer
can approve such a patch. A core reviewer can give a +2 and approval
in the same review.

Note that some projects hosted in OpenDev have a policy of requiring
*two* +2 votes instead of one. The OpenDev infrastructure enforces
only a single +2 vote, the rest is policy.

Work In Progress
================

The "Work in progress" (WIP) label tells anyone looking at a change
that more updates are still needed. Both the change's owner and any
core reviewer can set the WIP statusÀê

* A change owner can set this label on their own review to mark that
  additional changes are still being made, and to avoid unnecessary
  reviews while that happens.

* A core reviewer can set the WIP label to acknowledge that a
  contributor will definitely need to do more work on a change rather
  than merely expressing an opinion on its readiness. This can be a
  great convenience to fellow reviewers. It allows the core reviewer
  to politely send the message that the change needs additional work
  while simultaneously removing it from the list of ready changes
  until that happens.

A WIP label gets reset when a new patch is uploaded. The reviewer
that sets a WIP label, can also reset it.

Re-approval
===========

As covered in :ref:`automated-testing`, developers can take steps when
Zuul tests fail. Core reviewers, like other developers, can use these
same steps when rerunning tests. Core reviewers have an additional tool
for cases where gate testing fails due to reasons unrelated to the
current change, re-approval.

Core reviewers can approve changes again to trigger gate testing for
that particular change. Core reviewers should still heed the advice in
:ref:`automated-testing` to ensure that unrelated failures are
properly tracked. Note that the change will directly enter the gate
pipeline if and only if it has already a +1 vote from Zuul,
otherwise it will first enter the check pipeline like a "recheck"
would.
