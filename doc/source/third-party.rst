Terms
===============
Build Succeeded - This term defines the condition that the build completed all of the tests successfully, regardless of whether the tests passed or failed.  At this time, there is no way to absolutely define which tests should fail under which circumstances; however the infra team is undergoing efforts to provide a measure of build system calibration.

Build Failed - This term defines the condition that the build was not able to run to completion.  A build failure is related to a fault of the build system performing the test, and or may be the result of one or more failed tests.
