Infrastructure User Manual
##########################

The OpenStack project uses a number of specialized tools and processes
while developing software that is part of the project.  This manual
will help you learn how to use them as a developer working on the
OpenStack project.

If you are not trying to contribute to OpenStack directly, but are
instead a user or developer looking for API documentation, see
`OpenStack documentation <https://docs.openstack.org>`_.

.. important::

   You can always check the status of the OpenStack CI infrastructure via:

   * https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Status
   * `@OpenStackInfra
     <https://twitter.com/openstackinfra>`_ on Twitter.
   * the topic in IRC

   If you notice problems, report them via
   :ref:`#openstack-infra on IRC <irc-technical-support>` or
   use the `OpenStack-Infra mailing list
   <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-infra>`_.
