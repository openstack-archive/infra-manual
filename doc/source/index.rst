Infrastructure User Manual
##########################

The OpenStack project uses a number of specialized tools and processes
while developing software that is part of the project.  This manual
will help you learn how to use them as a developer working on the
OpenStack project.

If you are not trying to contribute to OpenStack directly, but are
instead a user or developer looking for API documentation, see
`OpenStack documentation <http://docs.openstack.org>`_.
