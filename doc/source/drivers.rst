Targeting Blueprints
====================

Blueprints for a program or project will be posted to https://blueprints.launchpad.net/<projectname>. Project drivers will need to review blueprints regularly and assign them to a target. For each release there are three milestones. Based on interactions with the proposer and/or assignee of the blueprint, the project driver will assign the blueprint to a milestone (release-1, release-2 or release-3) or defer it to a later release.

Interactions with release management will include discussions of the blueprint target page: https://launchpad.net/<projectname>/+milestone/{release name}-{1|2|3} The more the blueprint target page reflects the reality of progress and intentions, the happier the release management team.
