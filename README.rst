OpenStack Infrastructure Manual
===============================

This manual is designed to provide documentation on how the
OpenStack Infrastructure program configurates and operates
the various tools that comprise its architecture.

At this point, this is a work in progress as existing
documentation from various sources is added to this source.
New documentation will also be added as it becomes available.

The idea is that it will be a three-part user's manual for the
OpenStack project infrastructure:

  * Developer's User Manual
  * Core Reviewer's User Manual
  * Project Driver's User Manual

It will contain information on how to work with git, git-review,
gerrit, zuul, jenkins, etc., all targeting those three kinds of
users.  It should completely replace this document:

  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritJenkinsGit

And much of the content in:

  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritWorkflow

As well as these parts of the current infra docs:
